//! Implements a SAT solver for dependency resolution based on the CDCL
//! algorithm (conflict-driven clause learning)
//!
//! The CDCL algorithm is masterly explained in [An Extensible
//! SAT-solver](http://minisat.se/downloads/MiniSat.pdf). Regarding the data structures used, we
//! mostly follow the approach taken by [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv). The code of
//! libsolv is, however, very low level C, so if you are looking for an
//! introduction to CDCL, you are encouraged to look at the paper instead or to
//! keep reading through this codebase and its comments.
