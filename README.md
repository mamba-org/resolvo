Resolvo implements a fast package resolution algorithm based on CDCL SAT solving.

### Projects using `resolvo`

- [`rip`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rip): An async package resolver and installer for Python PyPI packages
- [`rattler`](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler): Conda package resolver and installer (non-async)
- [`resolvo-rpm`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/resolvo-rpm): Experimental RPM resolver for Fedora / RedHat / OpenSUSE ... RPM packages
- ... add yours!

## Features

If resolvo is unable to find a solution it outputs a human-readable error message:

```
The following packages are incompatible
├─ bluesky-widgets >=0, <100 can be installed with any of the following options:
│  └─ bluesky-widgets 42 would require
│     └─ suitcase-utils >=0, <54, which can be installed with any of the following options:
│        └─ suitcase-utils 53
└─ suitcase-utils >=54, <100 cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
   └─ suitcase-utils 54, which conflicts with the versions reported above.
```

Resolvo provides a generic interface which allows integrating the solver with a variety of package managers. For instance resolvo is used in [rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) and [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) to solve packages from the conda ecosystem.

Originally resolvo started out as a port/fork of [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv) but it has since then diverged substantially. However, the same CDCL algorithm based on MiniSats [An Extensible SAT-solver](http://minisat.se/downloads/MiniSat.pdf) is still used underneath. Major differences compared to libsolv are:

* Resolvo does not come with built-in support for several packaging ecosystems but instead provides a generic interface to allow it to be used in different scenarios.
* Resolvo has support for incremental/lazy solving. This allows users to quickly find solutions in ecosystems where retrieving package metadata is expensive.
* Resolvo is considerably faster than libsolv in large complex cases.
* Resolvo can easily be used in multithreaded environments.
* Resolvo provides human-readable error messages out-of-the-box.
* Resolvo optionally provides an async interface to allow concurrent metadata fetching.
* However, Libsolv is more extensive and supports more complex queries.
